# 📦 Products Review Loader

A small educational project using `async/await` and fake API functions to load product reviews dynamically.

## 🧠 Description

This app simulates fetching product data and reviews with artificial delays using Promises and `async/await`.

The goal is to:
- Load a list of products
- Load reviews for each product
- Display the first review's author's name (if any)

All actions are logged in the browser **Console**.

2. Click the button  
3. Open Developer Console (`F12` or Right-click → Inspect → Console)
